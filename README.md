# sample-invoice-app


Welcome to the sample-invoice-app! Generally, this project is one that allows a user to make and pay invoices via a React front end and an express.js backend. This repository has three main directories as follows:


* `shared`: This houses the common data models, `Invoice` and `Payment`. It allowed me to now have to maintain them in both the front and backends

* `backend`: This is the express.js server


* `clientApp`: This is the front end React app



Each directory has a `README.md` file which will tell you more information.
